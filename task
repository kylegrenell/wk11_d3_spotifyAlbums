AJAX Homework
Learning Objectives

Practice making AJAX requests and display data on the HTML page
Practice traversing the data structure received from an API
Display a list of album titles using the endpoint 'https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?q=christmas&type=album'.

You'll have to study the structure of the data that the API returns and work out what pieces of data you'll need to pull out of it to use.

We have provided a skeleton start point.

Further

Make each title link to the album in Spotify.
